## Course Description

* Studies: Data Science for Life Sciences (DSLS)
* Teacher: Martijn Herber (HEMI)

This course introduces students first and foremost to distributed programming (parallel programming). It introduces a number of libraries and frameworks to do so, and the underlying theory to understand them. The focus is on applying these frameworks to (big) data rather than creating new frameworks. Some of the tools covered are (not necessarily in this order);

1. The Python Multiprocessing library
2. The Dask library for parallelizing numpy/pandas/scikit-learn calculations.
3. The MapReduce paradigm and the implementation of it in Apache Spark.
4. Distributed data storage; Spark Dataframes and Apache Cassandra.
5. The GNU Parallel library
6. The SLURM workload manager
7. The SnakeMake pipeline generation framework. [OPTIONAL]

In addition to these parallel computing topics the focus in the course will also shift from writing jupyter notebook based python scripts to writing "proper" python programs with all the software engineering details. I.e. we will focus on object-oriented design, documentation, testing, debugging. It's time to write proper programs!

## Course Setup
This is a practical course consisting of 5 weekly assignments and 1 (graded) final assignment. You must hand in the weekly assignments to pass the course. The solution to each assignment can be found inside their own directory (`AssignmentX/`). 

Each folder contains a `README` file explaining the assignment in further detail. It also might contain more information if it is required.
